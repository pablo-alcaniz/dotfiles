"IMPORTANT : Manjaro KDE users
Manjaro ships with a default configuration for SDDM (the default login manager for KDE) which overrides 
some keys needed by optimus-manager. To use optimus-manager, you need to edit the file /etc/sddm.conf and 
simply put a # before the line starting with DisplayCommandand the one starting with DisplayStopCommand."
